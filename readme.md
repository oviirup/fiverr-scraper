# Fiverr Scraper Extension ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-gold)

A simple, but effective scrapping extension that helps you to store other gigs as a reference for future use, or to feed into an ai chatbot.

## Motivation

I started my journey as a freelance web developer on [Fiverr](fiverr.com). I was pretty bad at creating a gigs for my services, at least it was not optimized for SEO in fiverr. I used references from top sellers, but it was little hard to keep track.

I used notion, obsidian, and few other note taking services to keep a record of the references, but again it was time consuming and cumbersome. Also automated web-scraping is not a good solution.

This extension is meant to do that manual task for you. It allows you to scrape data manually on click of a button and download it as a file, or you can use them in a chat-bots that can create a gig for you from those references.
